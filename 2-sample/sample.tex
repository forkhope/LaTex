\section{Some Interesting Words}
Well, and here begina my lovely article.
\section{Good Bye World}
\ldots{} and here it ends.

% Example 1
when Einstein introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
    e = m \cdot c^2 \; ,
\end{equation}
Which is at the same time the most widely known
and the leaset well understood physical formula.


% Example 2
\ldots from which follows Kirchhoff's current law:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
\end{equation}

Kirchhoff's voltage law can be derived \ldots


% Example 3
\ldots which has several advantages.

\begin{equation}
    I_D = I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
is the core of a very different transistor model. \ldots

My phone number will change soon.
It will be \mbox{0116 291 2319}.

\mbox{\emph{filename}} should

Footnotes\footnote{This is a footnote.} are often used by people using

    \item You can nest the list environments to your taste:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item But it might start to look silly.
            \item[-] With a dash.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Therefore remember:
        \begin{description}
            \item[Stupid] things will not become smart because they are
                in a list.
            \item[Smart] things, though,
                can be presented beautifully in a list.
        \end{description}

\part{This is a part}
A typographical rule of thumb for the line length is:
\begin{quote}
    On average, on line should
    be longer than 66 characters.
\end{quote}
This is why \LaTeX{} pages have such large borders by default
and also  borders by default and also why multicolumn print
is used in newspapers.
